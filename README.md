# Beta Booking

Are you also tired of entering all your data over and over again to book your bouldering timeslots?
Is so, then this is the perfect browser extension for you!  

This extension lets you autofill the form when booking you bouldering timeslot at the Beta bouldering gym in Hanover.
Your can enter your booking information on the options page of this extension. Your data is saved locally on your
device and not uploaded or shared with anyone.

As of now the extension assumes you have a monthly subscription to the gym and preselects this option for you. If you
have a different subscription/payment method you will have to configure that manually when booking for now, sorry!
